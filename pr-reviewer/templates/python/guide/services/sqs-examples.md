# Amazon SQS examples {#aws-boto3-sqs-examples}

::: {.meta description="" keywords="AWS SQS"}
:::

The code examples in this section demonstrate using the Amazon Web
Services (AWS) SDK for Python to call the Amazon Simple Queue Service
(Amazon SQS). For more information about Amazon SQS, see the [Amazon SQS
documentation](http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sqs/).

Each code example requires that your AWS credentials have been
configured as described in `guide_quickstart`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. Some examples require additional prerequisites which are
described in the example\'s section.

The source files for these and other code examples are available in the
[AWS Code
Catalog](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/python/example_code)
on GitHub.
