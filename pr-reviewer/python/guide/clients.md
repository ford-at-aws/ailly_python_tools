# Low-level clients {#guide_clients}

Clients provide a low-level interface to AWS, mapping closely to service APIs. If you want full control over AWS services and can handle the intricacies of API calls, clients are your tool of choice. They are generated from a JSON service definition file, which means they are always up-to-date with the latest API features. Here’s how to leverage them effectively.

## Creating clients

Creating clients is the first step in interacting with AWS services using boto3. Let's do it right.

### Basic Client Creation

First, you need to create a client for the service you want to interact with. This involves a simple call to `boto3.client`, but don't let the simplicity fool you—there are some best practices to keep in mind:

```python
import boto3

# Create a low-level client with the service name
sqs = boto3.client('sqs')
```

#### Best Practices:
- **Secure Credentials Management**: Never, under any circumstances, hardcode your AWS credentials in your code. Use IAM roles for EC2 instances or the AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`) for local development. Environment variables can be an option, but keep security top-of-mind.
  
  ```bash
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key_id'
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_access_key'
  ```

- **Explicit Region Specification**: Always specify the AWS region when creating a client. Implicit defaults can lead to unexpected behavior and cross-region latency issues. Be explicit and deliberate:

  ```python
  sqs = boto3.client('sqs', region_name='us-west-2')
  ```

### Accessing Clients from Resources

If you're working with high-level resources but need to drop down to low-level client operations, you can access a client from a resource. This gives you flexibility without redundancy.

```python
# Create the resource
sqs_resource = boto3.resource('sqs')

# Get the client from the resource
sqs = sqs_resource.meta.client
```

## Service operations

When interacting with AWS services via clients, every method call directly maps to an API operation. This means you need to understand AWS APIs or you'll risk misconfigurations and errors.

```python
# Make a call using the low-level client
response = sqs.send_message(QueueUrl='...', MessageBody='...')
```

#### Best Practices:
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: AWS operations can fail for various reasons—network issues, permissions, throttling. Always wrap client calls in try-except blocks and handle `botocore.exceptions.ClientError` to manage these gracefully.
  
  ```python
  import botocore

  try:
      response = sqs.send_message(QueueUrl='...', MessageBody='...')
  except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as error:
      print(f"An error occurred: {error.response['Error']['Message']}")
      raise
  ```

- **API Documentation**: The boto3 client method names follow Python's snake_case convention, but they directly correspond to AWS API operations. Familiarize yourself with AWS's [API documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html) for precise control over your interactions.

## Handling responses

Responses from AWS services are returned as Python dictionaries. The structure of these dictionaries closely follows the AWS API response format, so you need to be adept at navigating and extracting data from them.

```python
# List all your queues
response = sqs.list_queues()
for url in response.get('QueueUrls', []):
    print(url)
```

The `response` in the example above looks something like this:

```json
{
    "QueueUrls": [
        "http://url1",
        "http://url2",
        "http://url3"
    ]
}
```

#### Best Practices:
- **Defensive Coding**: When accessing dictionary keys, always use `dict.get(key, default)` to avoid KeyErrors. Design your code to handle missing or unexpected data gracefully.
  
- **Logging**: Integrate comprehensive logging into your response handling logic. This helps in monitoring and debugging, providing visibility into the API interactions.

  ```python
  import logging

  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

  response = sqs.list_queues()
  queue_urls = response.get('QueueUrls', [])
  if queue_urls:
      for url in queue_urls:
          logger.info(f"Queue URL: {url}")
  else:
      logger.warning("No queues found.")
  ```

- **Data Validation**: Validate response data to ensure it meets your expectations before further processing. This is crucial for building reliable applications, as AWS API responses can vary based on the request context and state.
