  <summary><h2>Program Flow and Readability</h2></summary>

### Guidelines
* Code examples should prioritize educational value and readability:
* Examples should not include code that only duplicates an API reference without additional information or context.
* Function and variable names must be clear and free of typos, with consistent capitalization and naming patterns.
* Complex logic should include descriptive comments.
* Examples must not include unreacheable code, code that does not compile or run, or code that is commented out.
* Prefer to create files as part of the examples to limit including multiple "[example].txt" files throughout the repository.
* When constructing SQL queries, use parameterized values instead of directly concatenating commands with user input.
* AWS Console setup should not be required in order for the example to run. Any setup should happen as part of a CFN or CDK template or script, or in the program itself. The only exception is for "feature access", such as enabling access to a Bedrock model.
* Provide customers with appropriate context in published documentation through metadata and snippet organization.

### Specification Instructions
* Describe the program flow and instructions for readability, file creation, and CFN or CDK resource deployment.

<details>
  <summary><h2>Code Comments</h2></summary>

### Guidelines
* Code comments must be descriptive, use complete sentences (with punctuation), and be free of typos or grammatical errors. 
* Language owners may establish their own patterns for comments (such as parameter and method descriptions) and should follow those patterns consistently.

### Specification Instructions
* Describe any important comments that should be included in all implementations.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Pagination</h2></summary>

### Guidelines
* When pagination is available (determined by checking the service client for paginators), the available paginator must be used. 
* In cases where a subset of items is intentionally fetched, it should be noted in the code comments.
* If the intent is listing "all" items, pagination should be included to return all pages of data.
* Hello Service examples should still demonstrate pagination if available, but can log the total count of items (along with a subset of the list, if desired) instead of listing all items.

### Specification Instructions
* Indicate where pagination is required.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Waiters</h2></summary>

### Guidelines
* When a waiter is available, it should be used in the example. 
* If no waiter is available, the program should poll for the applicable status before continuing. 
* If a sleep() function is used, a descriptive comment must be included explaining why.

### Specification Instructions
* Indicate where a waiter is required.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Error Handling</h2></summary>

### Guidelines
* Each discrete service call with specific exceptions (such as "resource not found" or "resource already exists") should demonstrate capturing at least one possible exception and handling it appropriately. 
* Examples should not break/quit for their exception handling unless there is a reason to do so, so that resources can be cleaned up gracefully.

### Specification Instructions
* Indicate which specific exception should be handled, and what should happen when that exception is caught.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Resource Strings</h2></summary>

### Guidelines
* Resource ARNs or names should either be entered by the user, provided as program arguments, or loaded from a separate configuration. 
* Code should not use hard-coded strings or "<REPLACE_THIS_STRING>" placeholders to access necessary resources. 
* Examples should not use hard-coded Regions unless necessary for the example.

### Specification Instructions
* Specify how program arguments should be loaded.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Security (Username/Passwords)</h2></summary>

### Guidelines
* User names and passwords or other security artifacts should be entered by the user and not referenced as hard-coded strings. 
* They should not be stored or retained, and only pass through to the necessary service, in cases such as Cognito user setup or RDS admin setup actions which require a password.

### Specification Instructions
* Describe any special handling for security items.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Test Coverage</h2></summary>

### Guidelines
* New code should have test coverage (can be unit or integration) for each method or logical operation block. 
* Refer to the SDK language specification page for test tool details.

### Specification Instructions
* Follow general guidance for testing, no additional specification requirements.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Configuration Explanations</h2></summary>

### Guidelines
* If any user configuration, program Args, or other setup is required, they should be described in the code comments and/or the README for that service or services(s).

### Specification Instructions
* Include descriptions for configurations if they are language-agnostic.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Resource Creation and Cleanup</h2></summary>

### Guidelines
* Scenarios should include one or more “clean up” functions. These should be highly error resistant, logging but not stopping on any resource removal errors. 
* The clean up function should always run, possibly by storing any error(s) from the main body and reporting them after attempting clean up.
* Resources created as part of an example should be cleaned up as part of the program. 
* Clean up can include a y/n question to the user before deleting resources. 
* If a scenario does not complete due to errors, it should attempt to run the cleanup operation before exiting.

### Specification Instructions
* Include a description if anything other than a y/n question is needed.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Digital Assets and Sample Files</h2></summary>

### Guidelines
* Examples should follow the repository standards for adding and managing digital assets and sample files.

### Specification Instructions
* Include instructions for retrieving/using any shared digital assets. Prefer shared assets over duplication in each language folder.
