# AI PR Reviewer

This repository contains a Python script, `review.py`, that automates the review of Pull Requests (PRs) by analyzing changes and generating feedback based on predefined standards.

## What It Does

- **Gray Matter Headers**: Converts content into a format ready for processing.
- **Git Operations**: Checks out the PR branch, generates a diff, and then returns to the main branch.
- **Markdown Generation**: Creates markdown files from the standards provided in an HTML file.
- **Ailly Integration**: Uses the Ailly tool to review the PR diff based on standards and generates a summary of issues.
- **File Management**: Renames processed files and cleans up unnecessary files.

## Requirements

Make sure you have:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Git**
- **[Ailly](https://github.com/davidsouther/ailly)** (a tool for reviewing PRs)

## How to Use

**Run the Script**:
   Provide the URL of the forked repository you want to review:
   ```sh
   python review.py <fork URL>
   ```

   Example:
   ```sh
   python review.py https://github.com/user/repo-name/branch-name
   ```

## What to Expect

The script will:

1. **Set Up Logging**: Tracks all actions.
2. **Prepare Directories**: Creates a unique directory for storing files related to the review.
3. **Process Standards**: Turns sections of the `standards.html` file into markdown files.
4. **Handle Git Operations**: Checks out the PR branch, generates a diff, and cleans up.
5. **Run Ailly**: Reviews the diff using Ailly and generates feedback.
6. **Rename Files**: Renames and cleans up files as needed.

## After Running

Look in the `standards` directory for:

- Markdown files created from the standards.
- A markdown file with the diff and review feedback.
