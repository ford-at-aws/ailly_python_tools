For a provided file, use your best judgment to determine which of the provided service-specific error codes that may appear in the usage of this SDK Service Client class.

Be judicious in this answer, as some error codes are more higher-value and commonly encountered than others, e.g. A customers using the EC2 AllocateIP's API is highly likely to eventually encounter the AddressLimitExceeded exception.

Give me only the high value error codes that seem to suit well the use case, and provide concise but authoratative justifcation for your answer.
